## What is Solarflow Control

Solarflow Control originally was meant to automatically control Zendure's Solarflow hub with more flexibility to match home power demand and without the official mobile app.
Since its first use case it has now evolved into a more sophisticated solution to also control micro-inverters (mainly via OpenDTU and AhoyDTU), read current household demand from various smartmeter readers (Hichi, Tasmota, Shelly 3EM, PowerOpti, ...) to realize optimal charging/discharging and zero-feed-in solar generation.

It's main features are:
- Support power generation from solarpanels connected to Solarflow Hub AND directly to the inverter. Control the SF Hub and the inverter so that direct power generation takes precedence for feed in and panels connected to the HUB are used for charging the battery
- Auto-adjust houshold feed-in, via matching to demand read from typicall smartmeter readers. (e.g supporting all three phases of Shelly 3EM)
- Ensure SF battery health and drift regulation by automatically ensuring the battery gets fully charged every couple days even during low light seasons.
- Zero-feed-in: when possible solarflow-control will limit the input so that no input to the grid is performed.
- Auto-detect Inverter Channels from OpenDTU/AhoyDTU
- Integration with HomeAssistant
- Configurable minimum charge power of the battery
- Configurable maximum home output power
- Controlling "offline" Solarflow Hubs, without any dependency to an internet connection or Zendure's Cloud services, LAN only!


This project is tightly related to (and works together with) my other projects related to Solarflow Hub

*solarflow-control leverages telemetry data from all involved devices and controls them accordingly*

### Preamble
To control how much data is fed from the Solarflow Hub to Home (our main goal) we need to (i) find out how much power we need at any given time and (ii) be able to steer the output to home either via the inverter or the solarflow hub (or both), in dependency of any panels connected directly to the same inverter as solarflow.

The first step can be best achieved by reading your home's smartmeter on the fly. There are various options to do that (PowerOpti, Shelly EM devices, Hichi Smartmeter reader, BYO devices, ..). I'm using a Hichi IR head to get the current house demand into a local MQTT broker.
The second step is the controlling of how much power the Solarflow Hub will feed to home. This can generally be achieved in two ways:

 - by limiting the connected microinverter so it only takes what is needed. If there are panels directly connected to the inverter steering might also involve limiting the Solarflow Hub

 - by setting the Solarflow Hub's own "output to home" parameter on the fly. In the mobile app you could do this manually or via schedules, but not very granular (only 100W steps at time of this writing). But the hub can also be controlled via MQTT in a better way. This is what we can use

 As most components involved typically exchange telemetry via MQTT or can be controlled via MQTT I recommend to set up your own MQTT broker (if you haven't already done so for other home automation purposes)

### How to use
A prerequisite is to take your Solarflow Hub "offline", meaning to disconnect it from the Zendure cloud and have it only reporting to your local infrastructure/MQTT.
Solarflow control is best run via Docker (or even docker-compose), this avoids dependency problems and ensures portability. To get the latest version you can run:

```
docker pull rbrandstaedter/solarflow-control:latest
```

The configuration is done via the ```config.ini``` file which must be mounted into the container (read-only).
Example ```config.ini```

```
[global]
# DTY Type: either OpenDTU or AhoyDTU
dtu_type = OpenDTU
# Smartmeter Type: either Smartmeter (generic, Tasmota, Hichi, ...), PowerOpti, Shelly3EM
smartmeter_type = Smartmeter

# Geolocation LAT/LNG (e.g. latitude = 48.234, longitude = 12.534)
# if not set we will try to get it via geo-ip lookup, might be inacurate
#latitude =

# Offset in minutes after sunrise/before sunset. Can be used to set the duration of what is considered "night"
#sunrise_offset =

cur_accessor = Power.Power_curr
total_accessor = Power.Total_in

[poweropti]
# Username and password for you Powerfox API to get readings (internet connection required)
poweropti_user = <PowerFox API user>
poweropti_password = <Powerfox API password>

min_charge_power = 125
max_discharge_power = 150
max_inverter_limit = 800                                                
limit_inverter = true
inverter_min_limit = 10
```

Run the container with this command, mounting the ```config.ini```:

```docker run -v ${PWD}/src/config.ini:/solarflow/config.ini --name solarflow-control rbrandstaedter/solarflow-control:latest```

The initial startup will prompt all the settings applied and also the MQTT topics that are used. Note the lines with "... subscribing:" are the topics that should be present in your MQTT broker. Those are relevant for the tool to work properly.

After a short time you should see additional log lines for the Solarflow Hub (HUB), the inverter (INV) and the smartmeter (SMT). Here you will see the individual components (HUB,INV,SMT) slowly populating with data from MQTT.
If either of them doesn't update data you likely have a issue with the MQTT subscription topics.

After some more time you should see a ```Triggering telemetry update ...```. This forces the Solarflow hub every now and then to send all it's telemetry data (like battery state, etc.).
Finally, when enough data is collected, you will see the tool starting it's work:
